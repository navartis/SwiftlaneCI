# SwiftlaneCI

This an example implementation of your CI jobs runner built with [Swiftlane](https://github.com/swiftlane-code/Swiftlane) package.

This repo is just a minimal example showing how to get started with Swiftlane. We suggest you to check the code base of [Swiftlane](https://github.com/swiftlane-code/Swiftlane) repo to get a better understanding what you can do with it.

# What's inside

Simple CI job named `test-calculator` defined in [UnitTestsLaneCommand.swift](Sources/SwiftlaneCI/Commands/UnitTests/UnitTestsLaneCommand.swift) which will:
* Build and run unit tests
* Check for build errors
* Check for build warnings
* Check **Coverage limits** per Target (what percent of each target is covered)
* Check **Coverage limits** for changed lines (what percent of changed lines is covered)
* Produce a nice looking `report.md` in the `Examples` directory
* In-code sample configs for all the tasks above

A bash script to run the job ([Examples/simple_ci_job.sh](Examples/simple_ci_job.sh)) which will:
* Clone and build `xcbeautify` & `xclogparser` into `Examples/deps`
* Build and run `SwiftlaneCI`

After the run you will find a few artifacts inside `Examples/swiftlane_builds` subdirectories:
* `derived_data` - derived data
* `logs`:
  * `system` - simulator logs
  * `test` - xcodebuild logs
* `results`:
  * `*.xcresult` - Xcode produced build & test results (which you can always open on another machine)
  * `xclogparser_report.json` - json build report generated by xclogperser
  * `build_report_html` - html build report generated by xclogperser
  * `xccov_report.json` - code coverage info generated by xccov
  * `_merged_result.junit` - JUnit unit testing report


# Getting Started

Clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/swiftlane-code/SwiftlaneCI
$ cd SwiftlaneCI
```

Try running the example CI job script:

```bash
$ cd Examples
$ ./simple_ci_job.sh
```

# Customization

The best way to customize the runner is to make a fork or a so-called private fork of this repo and modify it as you wish.

Review the configs at `UnitTestsLaneCommand+Configs.swift` & `SharedConfigFactory.swift` and change them to suit your needs.
